# Advent of code 2020 in Nim

This is an attempt at solving the Advent of code 2020 using Nim

I'm a beginner in this language, don't take the solution as a best practice, PR and comments are welcome

To run, you need Nim (I use Nim 1.4), go in the src folder and run `nim r dayXX.nim`. Every solution expects a file called _dayXX.txt_ as input

## Status
